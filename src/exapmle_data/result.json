            "text": "Evo Morales, Bolivia's president-elect, fresh from meetings with the leaders of Cuba and Venezuela, says that his country welcomes foreign investors, but it will not relinquish control of its natural resources.\n\"Bolivia needs partners, foreign investors, but not owners of our natural resources,\" Morales told reporters on Wednesday in Madrid where he was stopping as part of a continuing tour that includes visits to France, Belgium, South Africa, China and Brazil.\n\"My government ... is going to exercise its property right over its natural resources.\"\nHe also said that his government will not tolerate foreign companies that do not respect the law in Bolivia.\n\"We're going to have a radical attitude with all those oil companies that do not comply with Bolivian law, those that do not pay taxes, those that are smugglers,\" he said.\nSpeaking after meeting Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, the prime minister of Spain, Morales said he had told him that Spain would pardon nearly all of Bolivia's debt to the country in exchange for investment in education programmes, a measure the Spanish premier has been keen to apply to many Latin American countries.\nBolivia's debt to Spain is estimated at US$120 million.\n\"This is a great relief for me,\" Morales said.\n\"We want to put an end to our country's illiteracy rate.\"\nMorales then met King Juan Carlos at Zarzuela Palace on Madrid's outskirts.\n\"We're going to have a radical attitude with all those oil companies that do not comply with Bolivian law\"\nMorales arrived at Madrid's international airport aboard a Venezuelan jet provided by Hugo Chavez.\nOn Thursday, Morales flies to Brussels.\nIn the morning, he held talks with Miguel Angel Moratinos, the foreign minister of Spain, Jose Montilla, the industry minister, the Spanish employers' organisation and representatives of the Spanish-Argentine Repsol YPF oil company.\nSpeaking later, Montilla said he was confident his country could maintain smooth relations with Bolivia.\nHe said that international energy companies operating in Bolivia \"may see some changes in the rules of the game\", but also noted that Morales was aware of the role that Spanish and international companies play in job and income creation across Bolivia.\nAt one point during the news conference, he said he still could not believe that he was elected president and he compared his movement with that of socialist icon Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara.\nBut unlike Guevara, he said, he would work democratically for change, based on \"votes, not on bullets\".\nMorales's campaign promises to nationalise Bolivia's oil and natural gas was high on the agenda of his visit.\nThe tour is aimed at drumming up support for his incoming government, the first headed by an Indian in Bolivia's 180-year history, and also to show that he can hold his own on the world stage.\nSpain's Repsol YPF, which has invested US$1.08 billion in Bolivia, is one of the main foreign energy companies operating in the country.\nBolivia's proven and potential reserves total 53.3 trillion cubic feet of natural gas is second only to Venezuela in South America, according to the US Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration.",

            "text": "The inaugural Winter Youth Olympic Games here in Innsbruck is so far proving a success, just as the first Summer Youth Olympic Games in Singapore did two years ago.\nAdmittedly the event in Innsbruck is neither the size nor scale of Singapore 2010 but there is certainly the same fun atmosphere at all the sporting events and the unspeakably beautiful backdrop of the snow covered mountains in the Austrian city certainly rivals the impressive skyscrapers that have become a feature of the Southeast Asian city-state.\nSo while there are obvious differences, there are clear similarities, one of the most poignant of which is the continuing question of when will there be a Youth Paralympic Games?\nInternational Olympic Committee (IOC) President Jacques Rogge, the main credited as coming up with the idea of these Youth Olympics, is adamant that the creation of such an event lies firmly with the International Paralympic Committee (IPC).\n\"Well as you know, the International Paralympic Committee is totally autonomous,\" he said when I asked him the question at a press conference.\n\"The Paralympic Committee does not take direction from the International Olympic Committee.\n\"We work very closely with them and we give them great support.\n\"But it is up to them to decide what they want to do.\"\nFor their part, the IPC admit that while it is something they are certainly considering, it is not a realistic goal right now because they are not, by their own admission, able to pump the huge financial resources into the event that the IOC are.\n\"It may happen one day but not now,\" the IPC chief executive Xavier Gonzalez told me the last time we spoke on the subject.\n\"The Youth Olympic Games is a great initiative from Jacques Rogge but evidently it is based on the ability the IOC has to be able to put together an event of such a big size in such a short time, which they did.\n\"We have not had any major discussions with the IOC about a Youth Paralympic Games.\n\"The IOC obviously focuses on its own Youth Olympic Games and has been totally respectful of the IPC in creating the first edition of the Youth Olympic Games.\n\"Even for an organisation like the IOC, it was a significant challenge to create the Youth Olympics.\n\"But for the IPC at moment, our main focus is on the Paralympic Games itself, which is still evolving.\"\nDespite some disappointment that there is no Paralympic competition to enjoy at the Youth Olympics, Gonzalez is undoubtedly right to focus the resources of the IPC on the Paralympics and specifically London – which by all indications should be a phenomenal event both for London and for the Paralympic Movement.\nThe superb International Paralympic Day in Trafalgar Square last September provided a glimpse of just what might happen if you get young children trying out wheelchair basketball or meeting their favourite athletes.\nFour time Paralympic champion Oscar Pistorius of South Africa, who was one of the top stars in Trafalgar Square, has now become a household name and his mouth-watering T44 100 metres showdown with America's Jerome Singleton show prove every bit as enthralling as its Olympic counterpart when – providing he doesn't false start – Usain Bolt should be relatively untroubled by anyone other than his own world record of 9.58 seconds.\nThrow into that Britain's biggest gold medal hopes, such as wheelchair racer Dave Weir and cyclist Sarah Storey, and the fact that that Britain should well finish in the top two on the overall medal table ,and get an exciting event that should enthral the home nation.\nThe event already looks likely to be sold out across the board in what would be an unprecedented feat and IPC President Sir Philip Craven has already stated that we could be in for something a bit special come London 2012.\n\"The year ahead has the potential to propel the Paralympic Movement to new unimaginable levels,\" he predicted in a New Year's Eve message.\n\"London is shaping up to match and maybe surpass what was achieved in Beijing, which is something I never thought possible.\n\"This is a big, big year, not just for the IPC but for the whole Movement, International Sporting Federations, National Paralympic Committees, Regions and founding federations.\n\"Together we can deliver something very special in London, and wouldn't it be fitting to deliver the best ever Paralympic Games in the country where it all started.\"\nSo while we may be left to wait some time for a Youth Paralympics, perhaps we shouldn't be too disappointment with London 2012 around the corner.\nIt will provide a true feast of Paralympic sport and just like the Youth Olympics; it will be able to turn relatively unknown teenagers into true superstars – just as the Beijing 2008 Paralympics did to certain 13-year-old swimmer by the name of Ellie Simmonds.\nFirst I guess I should introduce myself – I am Liam O'Reilly, a wheelchair tennis player first and foremost, and a third year Sports Psychology student at Roehampton University.\nI have a career high world ranking of 20 and I am currently around the top 35 mark in singles and top 25 in doubles after a year that hasn't exactly gone to plan. However, the experience I have gained this year I believe will be invaluable looking forward.\nI have now come to the end of my season and my team of trusted coaches and I are putting together my blueprint for next year.\nWe'll discuss our technical on court changes, what I want to be more powerful at in the gym and, mentally, how I can be stronger. A lot of athletes dislike this time of year. However, I feel this is when I get to put in the most amount of training and can really go all out without having to taper down for tournaments. It is also great on a personal level as it is probably the longest block of the year I get at home to spend time with friends and family.\nA usual day for me is quite tricky to explain, as every day of the week is different. I usually start bright and early at 5:45am, three days a week. I train at 7am due to court time, my technical coach's commitments and just my general love for early mornings (puzzling indeed). There's nothing worse than getting to training feeling tired and then finishing the session when I am starting to wake up. I try to beat slow morning starts as much as I can by having my first breakfast of the day bright and early. I cannot go out the door without cereal, but I'm not a huge fan of those ultra healthy oats and dried fruit combinations. The early sessions are technical with my coach, where at present we are changing a few aspects of my game so that hopefully next year I will have a lot more weapons to play with.\nI finish this session around 8:30-9am and it is then time for my second breakfast, sadly not a full English, but scrambled eggs or a protein shake. Then I jump in the shower before I head off to my university lectures. I count myself lucky as I only have four lectures a week this year, which are two hours each. However, the amount of work I have to do in preparation for these lectures and my assessments is intense and makes up for the lack of contact hours in university. Studying for my degree, combined with my training schedule, is definitely comparable to a full-time job.\nSo, after a morning lecture or a morning of independent working (my lecturers reading this will be equally as impressed as they are shocked), I head off to see my strength and conditioning team. My 'team' is pretty much my strength and conditioning coach, Bridgitte, and her intern Irish (no prizes for guessing where he's from), who I have the pleasure of seeing four times a week. At the moment we are at the early stage of a big strength block, which was something I really enjoyed last winter. Although I've never felt so much pain before, it has given me a great strength basis which I hope I can build on this year. After about an hour and a half of this, which also consist of lots of short interval pushing drills (the ones that make you feel like you will be sick) that is me done with those evil, but lovely, people for the day.\nThen I have an hour or so rest before a big and healthy - of course - lunch. I am currently on a high protein diet where I have to try and eat 110g of protein per day and have cut out pasta from my diet due to it being full of slow release carbs. This, for a student who likes to think he is a great cook but realistically isn't going to be on master chef any time soon, is quite inconvenient; however, the extensive range of meals I can now create with chicken is quite impressive.\nFinally I move on to my late sessions of the day, I do these twice a week from 8-10pm, which is never nice when you have to be up at 5:45am the next day, but I try to keep that to a minimum. These sessions are again on court, however, they are a lot more relaxed and I tend to do match play where I get to put into practice the things I work on with my coach, and keep my match play to a high level. Match play is crucial, especially in the off season, and I can have some fun in these which is always good. If you don't enjoy what you are doing you will never succeed.\nI also have probably two other on court sessions per week with other players and hitting partners as well as physiotherapy sessions and sport psychology sessions, which are all vital to my development.\nAway from training, I'm really looking forward to 2012. I'm really excited about the BT Storytellers project and what the next year has in store. I really can't begin to imagine how big an event it will be. I'm sure from January the media will begin to go crazy about it and the closer it gets the more exciting I'm sure it will get for all of the public.\nBeing from London it is so close to home, which is a once in a lifetime opportunity for everybody. Being lucky enough to be friends and training partners with a good few of the athletes that will be involved in a few of the sports will make it extra special for me. Seeing how hard they are training day in, day out and their excitement at reaching their dreams of representing Great Britain at the Olympic and Paralympic Games really inspires me to keep pushing on and hopefully reach these heights in a few years' time myself. This will be the first Paralympics I will have actual links with and a real connection to, and I will try and draw as much from this experience as possible for my future. I can only wish every single athlete the best of luck and really hope the whole of the country gets behind the team, whether you are at the events or watching on the television, as an athlete knowing you are being supported and people wanting you to do well is the biggest encouragement you can possibly get.\nThe London 2012 test events, officially known as the London Prepares series, have now been going on rather successfully since May this year but it was not until this weekend that the first stand-alone Paralympic test event got underway with the London International Goalball Tournament.\nThe two-day competition at the magnificent Handball Arena on the Olympic Park saw five women's teams in action as hosts Britain took on China, Canada, Sweden and the United States.\nIt was a superb few days in the spotlight for goalball – a sport not well known but a fascinating discipline nonetheless that sees two teams featuring three visually impaired players compete using a ball with bells inside it.\nBut perhaps more poignantly, the event provided us with our first true glimpse of what sport at the London 2012 Paralympics will look like.\nThose fortunate enough to attend International Paralympic Day (IPD) on September 8 this year will most likely agree that the special event in Trafalgar Square gave us very much a flavour of what the Games will feel like across the capital.\nAfter all, IPD saw big screens up, exhibition Paralympic events on show, come-and-try-out-the-sport-sessions and numerous appearances from high profile figures including Prime Minister David Cameron and the world's most recognisable Paralympian Oscar Pistorius of South Africa.\nBut it was in the Handball Arena that we actually got the chance to see what Paralympic sport itself will be like in its proper London 2012 setting.\nAlthough tickets were not on sale for the goalball, 4,000 were donated by London 2012 to local residents and schools to attend and they combine to create a fabulous atmosphere.\nThis might sound strange in a sport where the audience is required to stay silent - so that the players can hear the ball - but the silence itself actually manages to add huge tension and excitement to the play.\nI can perhaps only equate it to a tennis match, where the crowd will stay deafly silent before erupting when the point is won.\nThe silence is nothing if not hugely nerve-jangling.\nSo if the goalball test event is anything to go by, we are maybe starting to get an idea of what to expect.\nFor starters, China will be a major force at London 2012 and probably go on to top the medal table just as they did in Beijing after their goalball women's team, the reigning Paralympic silver medallists, easily won the goalball test event with victory over Canada in what can only be seen as an ominous warning shot for everyone else.\nWe can also expect the arenas to be fantastic, the spectators to be passionate and the competitors to be simply brilliant in terms of skill, ability and athleticism.\nBut most crucially, we can expect 'sport like never before'.\nIt is a phrase used constantly when referencing the London 2012 Paralympic Games and I asked Chris Holmes, the London 2012 director of Paralympic integration, what he wants those four symbolic words to mean to people.\n\"Sport like never before is a reference to what the real essence of what Paralympic sport is all about,\" said Holmes, who won nine Paralympic gold medals in swimming at four Paralympic Games, including six at Barcelona in 1992.\n\"A lot of people who attend London 2012 perhaps wouldn't have seen Paralympic sport before but what they will encounter is something truly incredible.\n\"They will see incredible athletes participating in incredible sport.\n\"The 2012 Paralympics will be a showcase of elite sport which highlights what can be achieved by people with an impairment and that is why we talk about sport like never before.\"\nSo while most of the attention will be on the likes of Pistorius, swimming star Ellie Simmonds and wheelchair racer Dave Weir, perhaps it might be a good idea to tune into sports such as goalball. You may just get the chance to see sport like never before.\nIt is over a week since the conclusion of the 2011 Parapan American Games in Guadalajara, Mexico and I've had some time to reflect on what was a great event.\nFirstly the local organising committee deserve credit for putting on a great showcase of parasport, whilst the people of Guadalajara and Mexico should also be recognised for providing some great hospitality and extremely vocal support for all our athletes and teams.\nThe Parapans were the last major international multisport event ahead of London 2012, and as a result competition across all sports was fierce, especially in team sports where some of the final qualification places for next year were at stake.\nI was at most of the team sport finals and the intensity of the Games was really something else.\nIn individual events many of the nations took different approaches. Brazil (pictured), for example, sent pretty much their strongest team to Guadalajara and this was reflected in the final medals table. They won 197 medals, including 81 golds, a feat that placed them well and truly at the top.\nOthers countries sent some young up and coming athletes to the Games with differing results, whilst others discovered new talents. USA uncovered two absolute gems who I would be surprised not to see in London next year.\nChelsea McClammer, a T53 athlete, had a great Games winning five gold medals and one bronze. She's only 17-years-old and may well feature for the US next year in the British capital.\nJarryd Wallace is also a name to look out for in 2012. He only had his leg amputated 15 months ago, yet in running 11.31 to win the 100 metre T44 gold, he ran faster than both Oscar Pistorius or Jerome Singleton did in the final at January's IPC Athletics World Championships.\nHost nation Mexico also discovered a star of their own in Luis Andrade Guillen, a winner of eight medals in the pool including four golds.\nParalympic sport is on something of an upward curve at the moment in the Americas and there is no place where it is enjoying more success than in Brazil.\nFollowing the Parapan American Games, a handful of us from the IPC have flown down to Rio for our first project review with the organising committee of the Rio 2016 Paralympic Games.\nDuring our stay in Rio it has been superb to see some of the media attention the Brazilian athletes have been enjoying on local and national news and rightly so.\nIt is not every day that an athlete wins an astonishing 11 gold medals in one Games and swimmer Daniel Dias deserves every bit of publicity he is getting at the moment. Dias will certainly be another one to watch next year in London.\nThe Brazil team was welcomed home from Mexico by the Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff, which again was well covered by the national media. That coverage reached fever pitch at the weekend when the logo for the Rio 2016 Paralympic Games was unveiled to the world.\nIn Brazil, the unveiling was broadcast live on one of the country's most popular TV programmes to an estimated 50 million people whilst nearly 100 other media attended to ensure the rest of the world see the new emblem.\nI am confident that something special is happening here in the Americas and our aim is to continue the momentum generated this week in Brazil and last week in Mexico through until the 2015 Parapan American Games and the 2016 Paralympic Games here in Rio.\nXavier Gonzalez is the chief executive of the International Paralympic Committee (IPC).\nMy aim is to become the first female Paralympic athlete to run the 100 metres under 12 seconds.\nIt has been a good year for me because at the 2011 International Paralympic Committee (IPC) World Athletics Championships in New Zealand in January, I won three gold medals in the T11 100m, 200m and 400m, breaking world records in the 100m and 200m.\nIn June, at a meet in Germany, I then lowered my own 100m world record of 12.13sec to 12.04.\nBut my ultimate goal is to make history by running the 100m in under 12 seconds and I am very close now.\nThat what I've been preparing myself to run in training and hopefully I can achieve this goal in Mexico at the 2011 Parapan American Games.\nMy other big goal is London 2012 and winning three gold medals there because at the Beijing 2008 Paralympic Games, I only won one gold medal in the 200m.\nI won a silver medal in the 100m and bronze medal in the in Beijing but I think if I am at my best, I get all three golds in the events at the Paralympics next year.\nWhat makes me strong is that I meet up with my main rival every day for training.\nI class myself as my biggest rival.\nI don't want to lose to Terezinha and I don't want Terezinha to lose to me.\nI also hope I can inspire people because all Paralympians with great achievements inspire me and I try to learn things from each of them.\nI particularly want to inspire people from my own country Brazil.\nParalympic sport in Brazil is getting bigger every day because the country is hosting the Rio Paralympic Games in 2016.\nI think Rio 2016 is a chance of showing the world that Brazil is not just the land of football.\nBrazil has athletes and winners in many sports and we hope the Brazilians will get to know their real heroes.\nIt's expected that by 2016, Paralympic Sports in Brazil will be at a level whereby athletes, investors and the audience feel there is professionalism and that, independent of our disabilities, we master our sports and we are as capable of great achievements as other athletes.\nIn June, I was injured during a training session falling from one of my horses. This has kept me on the sidelines and out of the saddle for a few months, costing me selection for the 2011 European Championships in September this year, which was unfortunate.\nAfter I fell I thought I'd just sprained my back but an MRI scan showed that I had actually fractured three vertebrae and crushed a fourth. It took over eight weeks for me to recover and I've only just started training again. I'm noticing that my fitness is somewhat lacking as a result. I've slowly been building back up to my normal routine. Even when I'm at the peak of fitness I still have some aches and pains so it's been tough.\nI use the team physio to prepare for competition and whilst I've been injured, the horses have been exercised by my staff, which is a bit like \"remote control\" riding - I use a microphone and stand on the ground watching! This is particularly important so that I'm involved in the general progression and training of the horses.\nI'm part of the BT Storytellers project, which has gathered 100 members of the public to tell their stories about the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.\nI had two BT Storytellers meet me at my stables a few weeks back. It was great to meet them both and for them to watch me ride. The Storytellers filmed and took photos throughout the afternoon and we even did a short interview, which features on the BT Storytellers website. I really think it's important that the history of London 2012 is recorded and this is why the BT Storytellers project is such a great thing to be a part of. It will be the people's Games, something that won't happen again in my lifetime. I think it's great that we have this opportunity before London 2012 to ensure our stories as athletes are told.\nIn terms of my preparation for London, it will be quite strange not to have to prepare the horses for flying abroad and I'll actually be preparing as if it's a national competition. The pressure from the media will be a challenge; I have to remember that I'm there to do a job.\nThe Paralympic stands should be packed out for the first time and home support is at an all-time high, which will be great. Paralympic athletes are becoming household names as people begin to understand that it isn't easy to win a gold medal.\nThe day before a competition my routine will vary depending on which horse I ride. I would normally exercise each horse, ensuring they are stretched, supple, and ready to work. My new horse, which has been sourced through the Lady Joseph Charitable Trust is a spotted Knabstrupper stallion called Lucas (pictured). He really is a beautiful horse and stands out a mile away. He still has a long way to go before next year and needs a lot of technical training but his personality is just fantastic, I hope he retains that. All of my horses are treated like any other, they are hacked out every week and are turned out in the paddocks every day, and they're not wrapped up in cotton wool like many people might think.\nI attended the BT British Olympic Ball recently, which was a great evening. It was held at Kensington Olympia where the Olympia Horse Show is held near to Christmas every year, it was quite a change in scenery!\nThe Grand Hall looked fantastic everyone got dressed up and had a wonderful evening in anticipation of the Olympics next year.\nNine-time Paralympic champion Lee Pearson is a BT Ambassador. BT is the official communications services partner for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Lee will be telling his London 2012 story through the BT Storytellers campaign here.\nSo this is it, just under a year to go now. A year sounds like a long time but in the world of sport; it's not long at all.\nMy life has been meticulously planned out since returning from Beijing 2008 Paralympics.\nEvery competition, every month, every week set out in a plan and I've been ticking them off as each one has been completed. Now it's the final run into the Paralympic Swimming Trials at the London Aquatics Centre next March.\nLife both in and out of the water seems to have increased in fervour. The tickets for the Paralympic Games went on sale not that long ago and I've been inundated from friends and relatives asking what events I am swimming in and when because they all want to see me compete.\nWith this increase in interest, I have been given a massive boost in my training. Yes, every day hurts and the day after does too but I want to be at the Paralympic Games in London 2012 so much because of the support from everyone I know. This feeling is multiplied every time I meet someone new. When they find out that I'm a current athlete preparing for such an event; they are excited just to they can say they too know someone in the Games. It brings every new person just that little closer to the Games on a personal side.\nLondon is going to be massive for a number of reasons. The Paralympics are coming home for a start so London is a Landmark Games in that respect. Being a home Games, London affords my friends and family that have only been well wishers in the past the chance to join in and come and see what I can do.\nWith Channel 4 following a number of athletes in their Best of British Season, it is giving everyone the chance to see athletes and learn a little more about them and their respective lives so that they are not just cheering a nation; they are cheering someone they can relate just that little bit more.",

            "text": "NORTH WATERBORO, Maine – The only light in the house came from the glow of three computer monitors, and Christopher Blair, 46, sat down at a keyboard and started to type. His wife had left for work and his children were on their way to school, but waiting online was his other community, an unreality where nothing was exactly as it seemed. He logged onto his website and began to invent his first news story of the day.\n“BREAKING,” he wrote, pecking out each letter with his index fingers as he considered the possibilities. Maybe he would announce that Hillary Clinton had died during a secret overseas mission to smuggle more refugees into America. Maybe he would award President Donald Trump the Nobel Peace Prize for his courage in denying climate change.\nHe had launched his new website on Facebook during the 2016 presidential campaign as a practical joke among friends – a political satire site started by Blair and a few other liberal bloggers who wanted to make fun of what they considered to be extremist ideas spreading throughout the far right. In the last two years on his page, America’s Last Line of Defense, Blair had made up stories about California instituting sharia, former president Bill Clinton becoming a serial killer, undocumented immigrants defacing Mount Rushmore, and former president Barack Obama dodging the Vietnam draft when he was 9. “Share if you’re outraged!” his posts often read, and thousands of people on Facebook had clicked “like” and then “share,” most of whom did not recognize his posts as satire. Instead, Blair’s page had become one of the most popular on Facebook among Trump-supporting conservatives over 55.\nIt was barely dawn in Pahrump, Nevada, when Shirley Chapian, 76, logged onto Facebook for her morning computer game of Criminal Case. She believed in starting each day with a problem-solving challenge, a quick mental exercise to keep her brain sharp more than a decade into retirement. For a while it had been the daily crossword puzzle, but then the local newspaper stopped delivering and a friend introduced her to the viral Facebook game with 65 million players. She spent an hour as a 1930s detective, interrogating witnesses and trying to parse their lies from the truth until finally she solved case No. 48 and clicked over to her Facebook news feed.\nOn display above Chapian’s screen were needlepoints that had once occupied much of her free time, intricate pieces of artwork that took hundreds of hours to complete, but now she didn’t have the patience. Out her window was a dead-end road of identical beige-and-brown rock gardens surrounding double-wide trailers that looked similar to her own, many of them occupied by neighbors whom she’d never met. Beyond that was nothing but cactuses and heat waves for as far as she could see – a stretch of unincorporated land that continued from her backyard into the desert.\nShe’d spent almost a decade in Pahrump without really knowing why. The heat could be unbearable. She had no family in Nevada. She loved going to movies, and the town of 30,000 didn’t have a theater. It seemed to her like a place in the business of luring people – into the air-conditioned casinos downtown, into the legal brothels on the edge of the desert, into the new developments of cheap housing available for no money down – and in some ways she’d become stuck, too.\nShe had lived much of her life in cities throughout Europe and across the United States – places such as San Francisco, New York and Miami. She’d gone to college for a few years and become an insurance adjuster, working as one of the few women in the field in the 1980s and ’90s and joining the National Organization for Women to advocate for an equal wage before eventually moving to Rhode Island to work for a hospice and care for her aging parents. After her mother died, Chapian decided to retire and move to Las Vegas, Nevada, to live with a friend, and when Las Vegas become too expensive a real estate agent told her about Pahrump. She bought a three-bedroom trailer for less than $100,000 and painted it purple. She met a few friends at the local senior center and started eating at the Thai restaurant in town. A few years after arriving, she bought a new computer monitor and signed up for Facebook in 2009, choosing as her profile image a photo of her cat.\nChapian didn’t believe everything she read online, but she was also distrustful of mainstream fact-checkers and reported news. It sometimes felt to her like real facts had become indiscernible – that the truth was often somewhere in between. What she trusted most was her own ability to think critically and discern the truth, and increasingly her instincts aligned with the online community where she spent most of her time. It had been months since she’d gone to a movie. It had been almost a year since she’d made the hour-long trip to Las Vegas. Her number of likes and shares on Facebook increased each year until she was sometimes awakening to check her news feed in the middle of the night, liking and commenting on dozens of posts each day. She felt as if she was being let in on a series of dark revelations about the United States, and it was her responsibility to see and to share them.\n“I’m not a conspiracy-theory-type person, but . . .” she wrote, before sharing a link to an unsourced story suggesting that Democratic donor George Soros had been a committed Nazi, or that a Parkland shooting survivor was actually a paid actor.\nChapian looked at the photo and nothing about it surprised her. Of course Trump had invited Clinton and Obama to the White House in a generous act of patriotism. Of course the Democrats – or “Demonrats,” as Chapian sometimes called them – had acted badly and disrespected America. It was the exact same narrative she saw playing out on her screen hundreds of times each day, and this time she decided to click ‘like’ and leave a comment.\n“Gross. Those women have no respect for themselves,” wrote a woman in Fort Washakie, Wyoming.\n“They deserve to be publicly shunned,” said a man in Gainesville, Florida.\n“Well, they never did have any class,” commented Shirley Chapian, from Pahrump, Nevada, and Blair watched his liberal mob respond.",

            "text": "It has been a journey of sorts ever since - undertaken to rediscover the self, redeem faith, redefine music, recreate every beat and most important of all, to rebel. The significance of being a traveller here isthat one ends up being a bohemian as well, \"It isn't following but making and even breaking one’s own ideologies, trends, rules, conventions…just the way doing rap in Punjabi helps me establish the meaning of being bohemian. It goes far beyond the literal meaning,\" asserts Bohemia, the renowned Punjabi rap star from California as he spells out the reason behind his name. He is in town to promote his latest album, Da Rap Star.\nIf Bohemia's name was the topic of discussion for some time, even his rap partner J Hind's was. With tattoos of Mahatma Gandhi, Subhash Chandra Bose and Shaheed Bhagat Singh on his arm and a name like that, we guessed the strong patriotic streak in him, which he affirms, \"Just like any Indian, I love my country too.\" J Hind feels in the USA, this all helps him to prove how great is India, \"These symbols make me feel as the representative of my country, and its history and culture.\"\nEvery decision of his life till now proves him to be one, \"Choosing Punjabi for the lyrics of my songs helped me express my views better. And choosing rap, a music genre devoid of melody, of any layers that can hide shortcomings in a singer's talent or compositions, helped me be honest and perform my best.\"\nFor him definition of rap music is, \"A music without pretense, where all that matters is voice and lyrics. A music which is bohemian and, in all senses, is me.\" Now that's Bohemia!\nWith this perception, it was natural for him to compose music and pen down lyrics himself. But there was another reason too, \"It made me stick to my culture. I don't deny being 'Americanised' but I inherit a background that I cannot forget. Singing desi rap connects me and even people from this subcontinent to their roots.\" The popularity of his albums, Vich Pardesan De and Paisa Nasha Pyar bears a testimony to the fact.\nOf late, among thousands of fans across the world, he found one in Akshay Kumar and vice versa, \"He is a great actor and a person for he is the one making efforts to rope in international stars and take Bollywood to people in the West. I was awed by his humility when he requested me to sing for his movie\". However, the flicks’ failing at the box office hasn't changed his opinion, \"Akshay doesn't believe in adhering to the tested success formulae. He keeps on experimenting with his movies and every experiment does not end up in an invention. With time, things will eventually work out.\" Having sung rap songs for Akshay's film Chandni Chowk to China, 8X10 Tasveer and a rap number in Priyadarshan's upcoming flick, De Dana Dan, he is all set to do more Bollywood projects.\nHis life history too reflects a rebel's streak in him, \"While in tenth standard when my brother and friends used to play out, I preferred to listen to Kishore Kumar, Mohammed Rafi, learn harmonium and read poetry by Mirza Ghalib\", he goes on to recite his favourite couplet, Hazaron khawishen aisi….\nBorn in Pakistan as David Roger, he moved to the USA when he was 12, thus it was natural for him to get influenced by the western and eastern music genres, \"I loved listening to the old Indian music and liked the style of rap music. That formed the genesis of my becoming a music lover.\" And then the amalgamation happened.\nAfter having achieved a lot, he still aims to remain focused on his ultimate goal, \"I will always strive to be original just the way Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan was at sufi, Gurdas Mann and Malkit Singh are in Punjabi, Jagjit Singh in ghazals, Lata Mangeshkar in Hindi music and Eminem is in rapping. Wish Bohemia would be the original in desi rap!\"\nA round of rallies, padyatras and press conferences are not enough for politicians. They need someone who can polish up their image and sell it 'smartly,' such that it is bought by all and sundry. Enter, the public relations (PR) professionals, experts in packaging and marketing.\nThis time, the politicians have taken a new route to image- building---PR professionals, who can source them with innovative ideas for campaigning, equip them with the facts, spruce up their lifestyle (for a given period) and market them as the most trusted brand. The tricity has a number of PR professionals doing the needful for their netas.\nSays P.K. Khurana, who works in coordination with Kehar Singh Koundel, Davesh Moudgil and Dheeraj Jain to give a positive spin to Satya Pal Jain's image. From framing press releases, organising press conferences, to guiding them on what to say, what not to say, what issues to focus on, these people take care of the 'political branding' of the leader.\n\"In earlier days, a marriage in the family would keep all members on their toes. Now, people hire caterers to facilitate marriage preparations. In the same way, PROs help to make the politicians' work easier, so that they can concentrate on important issues, rather than drafting releases or taking calls,\" he says.\nNow, what does this strategy planning encompass. \"It includes a complete media training programme, sending SMSes, direct mails, working on jingles, video and audio CDs, advising them on issues, guiding them on what they should wear, how they need to carry themselves in public and at press conferences,\" offers Khurana. He explains further, \"We have regular brainstorming sessions, where we come up with ideas and then unanimously decide on the feasible ones. This time, we have come up with a slogan: Dil ki suniye, Bhajpa chuniye. In addition to this, we have companies who send regular SMSes on behalf of the party candidate, giving information on anything new on the blog, or sending greetings on a festive occasion.\"\nOf the numerous things that they need to work on, improving the brand image is their main task. Vineet and Navnit Joshi from Trivani Media, who are working for a good number of SAD-BJP candidates, say, \"Our work can be defined as a third-party endorsement programme, wherein we take care of umpteen things, in order to promote the positive image of the leader and the party,\" offers the duo.\nThey focus and work on the word 'innovation.' We come up with wacky, out-of -the box ways to woo the voters. For instance, we will send a message through kite flying and parachute, wherein leaders will appeal to the public through these props. The two also feel that the role of PR professionals in political brand building is growing. \"A well-drafted publicity campaign can do a lot of benefit to the leader,\" remarks Navnit.\nThere is no way that politicians can ignore the role of their image builders, for everyone wants to sell an absolutely neat image.\nPriyanka, who looks after RJD candidate Haffiz Anwar-Ul-Haq's PR, defines it as a confidence-building exercise. \"My job is to work on the strengths of my client, such that the voters take a liking to him,\" says Priyanka. At the same time, she also feels that the major challenge is to beat old, repetitive ideas. \" I have to think differently from the rest, as this will reflect on my leader's image.\nWhat challenges do these professionals face? Narvijay Yadav of Specttrum PR, who is working for the BSP candidate, Harmohan Dhawan, finds getting the 'right media coverage' a challenge.\nBollywood doesn't shy away from experimenting and filmmakers are always game to bring about changes in the industry to yield better results. After multi-starrers and director duos, hiring multiple composers for one movie is the latest trend in filmdom.\nRecent releases like Firaaq, Aloo Chaat, Aa Dekhen Zara, Raaz - The Mystery Continues, Golmaal Returns, 8x10 Tasveer and Sikandar among others had multiple composers for their soundtrack.\n\"There are different situations in a film and each situation demands a different genre of music. The composers today are not as dynamic as yesteryears music directors like Shanker-Jaikishan, S.D. Burman and R.D. Burman. So in order to have different melodies for diverse scenes, different composers are roped in,\" Mukesh Bhatt, producer of Raaz..., said.\n\"More composers add different flavours to the album,\" added Bhatt, who roped in Raju Singh, Sharib Sabri, Toshi Sabri, Gourov Dasgupta and Pranay M. Rijia to create music for his hit thriller.\nBut Piyush Jha, director of Sikandar, said that bringing in more than one music director for a project doesn't mean that a filmmaker doubts any composer's capability.\n\"It's not that a composer is not capable of giving good music and that's why you sign more music directors. It is just that like one lyricist has a different thought process and approach from the other, similarly all composers have particular styles as their forte,\" said Jha, who has earlier made films like The King of Bollywood and Chalo America.\n\"Also there is no harm to try various composers for your film. Different people bring different inspirations to a film, like all actors bring varied energies to the project. Its a good trend that adds freshness,\" he added.\nWhile filmmakers rope in more than one composer to give their movie and added flavour, some composers too feel that working with others for the same soundtrack helps in churning out a healthy cocktail of songs.\n\"Working with other composers for a film definitely helps since everyone gives their ideas and their inputs towards the music of the film. This helps make the soundtrack better,\" said Uday of composer duo Justin-Uday.\nIn such an arrangement, is their scope for creative freedom?\n\"There is no confinement. Everyone knows what to do and works according to that. There is no overlapping,\" said Sharib, one of the composers of Raaz 2.\nUday also said there was no problem working with other composers. \"When you work with others on a film, you get ample creative freedom and breathing space. This is never a problem as such. As long as you are getting the credit of what you have done, there is no problem,\" he said.\nBut there are some who don't believe in this concept at all.\n\"We don't do multiple-composer films. We are willing to be part of only OST (original soundtrack) compilations, where we retain full ownership of our songs,\" said Vishal Dadlani of composer duo Vishal-Shekhar.\nShe may no longer be the face of brands like Coca-Cola and Nakshatra diamond jewellery in India, but Aishwarya Rai is still riding high on successful and long-standing international endorsements.\nAishwarya has completed nearly a decade of endorsing Swiss luxury watch brand Longines and international soap Lux. She has also been the brand ambassador of global haircare brand L'Oreal since 2003.\nNoted ad-man Prahlad Kakkar says Aishwarya is sought by well-known brands because she is more than just an actor and is often perceived as an ambassador of India.\n\"Aishwarya was never a big or major endorser of Indian products. She has an impressive list of international brands to her name and that's because she is not just an actor who can be judged on hits and flops, but the fact that she is a representative of the Indian woman and is an ambassador of the country,\" Kakkar, who made her famous as Sanju in a 1993 TV commercial for Pepsi, told said.\nEven representatives of the brands that Aishwarya endorses feel she adds a new dimension to their products.\n\"Aishwarya has been associated with us since 1999 and it is a big help. Not only in this country but also globally,\" Charles Villoz, vice president (sales) of Longines International, had earlier said.\n\"People across the world love Bollywood films and they go housefull. Wherever we have travelled (with Aishwarya) the response has been overwhelming. She is a global face and we would like to continue this association as long as possible,\" Villoz said.\nFor Aishwarya, who has made her presence felt internationally through English language films like Bride and Prejudice, Mistress of Spices, Provoked and Pink Panther 2, signing films and endorsements has been a very selective affair.\nWhen she was approached to promote L'Oreal's skin whitening cream, the beauty queen-turned-actor refused as she didn't want to endorse such a product especially in India, where one's skin colour is an issue, said a source close to Aishwarya.\n\"Whether it is films or endorsements, I am - and have been - very selective about my work. I take up work which suits me and fits in my schedule,\" Aishwarya had said earlier.\n\"I don't take projects that I cannot handle because I believe in totally fulfilling the commitments made by me,\" she added.\nBollywood actor Mallika Sherawat joined the league of Hollywood celebs including Kim Kardashian, Miley Cyrus, Victoris Beckham, David Beckham and Paris Hilton, after a Hollywood milkshake was named after her. Mallika, who visited Millions of Milkshakes in West Hollywood, has been honored with her very own milkshake called the Mallika shake, reports Contactmusic.\nThe Mallika shake includes blueberries, raspberries, blackberries, strawberries, and chocolate sauce.\nTo make the shake more appealing, it has been topped with whipped cream.\nActor-director Rohit Roy is all set to step into Amitabh Bachchan's shoes for the Bengali adaptation of 1973 hit film Abhimaan, best remembered for its songs like Teri bindiya re and superlative performances by the Big B and Jaya Bachchan.\n\"I'm doing a major project called Pa Ma Ga Re Sa, which is a modern musical love story. It will be my first Bengali film and it is special because it is based on Abhimaan. It is basically an adaptation of the film,\" Rohit said.\n\"The film has Gauri Karnik, who was seen in Sur before. And former Miss India (Earth) Reshmi Ghosh will be seen as the other woman. It is being directed by Surajit Dhar,\" he added.\nThe first schedule of the film has already been shot and Rohit, who has recently stepped in as the host of the third season of TV dance reality show Jhalak Dikkhla Jaa, will soon head to Kolkata to shoot a few more scenes of it.\nRohit has joined Jhalak... midway and is co-hosting the show with TV actor Shweta Tiwari.\n\"This show is very close to my heart. I watched the first season, hosted the second and now I'm hosting the third mid-way. I think even the producers have grown to like me and I'm really excited to be back on the host's seat,\" he said.\nOn the Bollywood front, the actor has a bouquet of films like Mittal Vs Mittal, Apartment and Alibaug in his kitty. And the actor, who had made his first stint with the arclights with popular TV show Swabhimaan, is excited about essaying different roles in each of these movies.\nIn 'Mittal Vs Mittal, I'm playing an abusive husband to Rituparna Sengupta, in Jagmohan Mundra's Apartment, I'm playing a very jovial, guy-next-door sort of a role and in Alibaug, my role is of a doctor who cheats on his wife. As an actor, I can't draw a line and decide a set kind of roles that I want to do, I have to be diverse and I am enjoying doing it,\" said Rohit, who also featured in hit film Shootout At Lokhandwala.\nBesides this, he is also toying with the idea of scripting his next directorial venture, which will be a remake of Basu Chatterjee's 1981 classic Shaukeen.\nChatterjee's film, about the adventures of three old men in Goa, starred Ashok Kumar, Utpal Dutt and A.K. Hangal, but Rohit's \"grand wish list\" for the cast of his \"glamorous\" version of the film includes Rishi Kapoor, Naseeruddin Shah and Boman Irani.\n\"We are trying to finish the scripting of this mad comedy. Though the idea of the film will be based on Shaukeen, the reason for their adventures would change and the setting would be more glamorous - maybe they would go to Las Vegas instead of Goa.\nThe only tryst with anything remotely close to 'farming' or need we say 'planting', Gaurav Sahai ever hadwas potted plants at his home. As we know, sooner or later, things you have your heart in, do come to your corner of the world. For Gaurav, it came in the form of a 'satisfying and experimental happening', and he named it Sattva. Before he digs into his 'heart’s calling', he cheerfully gives a low down on the process behind it, in a fast forward mode. \"I have lived with this guilt of using too much paper and wood for our lifestyle,\" says Gaurav, who has enjoyed his share of swanky offices, travel, time- pressed living of the corporate world (He's done his business management from US).\nIn the series on incidents happening in his life, he happened to read how Mahatma Gandhi managed to provide a self-contained set up through two farms, where people lived in equilibrium with the nature. \"Bang on, something I wanted to do,\" Gaurav puts in.\nAnd without getting into the ifs and buts of the this self- proposition, farming, Gaurav went ahead to plant community trees for a park in Panchkula. From here he graduated to planting just about everything 'organically' on one of his friends farm in Landara. \"Now, I know this where my heart was,\" he flashes a contended smile.\nGaurav and his wife Vandana Babbar grow almost all kinds of seasonal vegetables, winter and summer, pulses, fruits, exotic veggies such as broccoli, cherry tomatoes, celery on the farm. The produce is free from the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Sounds healthy? But, the behind the scene, it was a story of challenges, tough grind, uncertainty and skepticism. \"The first season was a beautiful disaster,\" smiles Gaurav. \"What made it so was unskilled labour, absence of good organic produce, pests, weeds, getting a good produce with the minimum use of machines, no labour for home delivery, little information on organic farming on Internet … loads of other things.\" \"I don't peep too much in the future,\" he offers, \"we are still taking each day as it comes.\" Presently Gaurav, grows the organic stuff on 2 acres of land, which can feed 30 families.\nOn Sattva? \"It's a community of people who want to eat healthy. Anyone who wants to fall in this league can be part of Sattva through farmsattva@gmail.com. Here, we will provide an assortment of organic veggies, fruits, pulses at your doorstep as per your demand and choice, explains Gaurav, who also feels that mandi's do not give the true of the produce to both farmers and buyers. \"I can also sell the produce at mandis, but I don't want to do so, because, I want people to know who is growing the organic produce for them. I will also want to know where the stuff is going. And for this, we ask our members and others to come to the farm, see what we are doing, plant seeds, having a good time with kids and go back thinking healthy.\"\nWhen some heavy-duty medical jargon; epidermis, stratum germinatum trans epidermal water, stratum corneum, microbes, glands etc etc enter the lecture dais, don't automatically believe it's anatomy! Neither a class on immunology nor a thesis presentation on tissue culture. The hospitality industry aspirants at Flying Cats-8, are out to study the basics of grooming-skin and hair care.\n\"They need to be taught the technical aspect also, like how the formation of skin takes place to help them know better,\" clears out Esther Kinder, Keune expert, Holland based academy. While the physiotherapist by profession is busy telling students the finer nuances of skin, there's just enough time to catch up with Wasim Ahmed, technical educator, here for the one-day session too. \"I'll be teaching them what hairstyles to follow, the problems, how to take care on a regular basis, maintain them, of course followed by the practical,\" he says. A lot actually goes into deciding that perfect hairstyle, beyond the obvious eyes, ears and aesthetics of the face. \"While deciding hairstyle for a person we keep in mind the profession, the personality, over all structure,\" he says while agreeing, the grooming is not a one-day affair. \"Whatever we'll be teaching them, needs to be incorporated. There's a difference between tips and practice, the earlier can be given in a few hours while the latter needs to be continual process,\" he signs off not before busting 'the myth' amongst Indian women. \"Too much of henna is not good, it dries your hair, it's a fixation in this country and not one stop solution to all the problems.\"\nMeanwhile, the students in the adjoining hall are just as they were left- all eyes and ears. This time, they've reached the circular motion in which products need be applied on face. Boys in tow too, with creams on their faces! \"When it comes to hair, simplest of shampooing and conditioning is the key to best looking hair,\" advises Esther. \"Have you ever seen a painter at work? He doesn't straightaway start painting, without first working on the base and making the surface ready for coat.\" The tried tested since granny's era formula of cleansing, toning and moisturising is still going strong. \"They are essential and astonishing, apart from this apply rose water twice a day, once in morning and see the difference.\" Let's see.\nPanorama '09, an event at the Government Art Gallery and Museum-10 was all about children with special needs. An initiative to explore and enhance their potential the event consisted of a mélange of events that helped the children to exhibit their creativity and innovation.\nAn event with a difference, it catered to a special audience and set out to provide a unique experience to the special children, which included the visually impaired, deaf, mute and the underprivileged.\nDa Milano, the luxury brand, has launched its luggage collection 2009. Crafted from the finest Italian leather, the luggage collection comprises of leather strolleys, overnight bags, travel handbags, passport cases and toilet bags. An essential wardrobe accessory; this collection of sophisticated travel accessories convey polish, finesse and subtle luxury.\nDa Milano's collection of travel luggage and strolleys is immaculately designed and detailed to perfection. The luggage is crafted from smooth textured Italian leather that has a subtle sheen. Fashionable, functional and sturdy, the travel gear is designed with multiple pockets and compartments to store all you're essentials. This enviable collection is a must have for all those who want to flaunt their luggage this holiday season! So whether on a luxury vacation at your favorite ski resort or cruising down the Mediterranean, the collection is an ideal travel companion.\nVersatile and unisex, the collection is designed for fashionable men and woman. The collection showcases vibrant spring-summer colours ranging from burgundy, mustard, olive, royal blue, white, grey, beige, black to brown.\nMake up moves towards a natural look. The dewy look is in for the younger lot, light tinted moisturizers finding favour, rather than foundation, both for day and night, with less shine for the night. Heavy foundations and shine on the face are definitely out. Look for a matte finish on the skin, if you want to be in. The aim is to project a sheer skin texture.\nEye make-up trends favour less mascara and coloured eye pencils for lining the eyes, like browns, burgundy and purple, with a smudged and smoky look. No harsh lines. Or go for colourful shadow at the lash line. For eye-shadow too, purple tones are becoming popular - like lilac, mauve and purple itself. Full, brushed up eyebrows find favour. Eye make-up is heavier. Eye liner is thicker on upper eye lids and extended outwards and slightly upwards. The eyeliner is thicker in the middle of the eye, like the 70s look. For the lower eyelids, a lighter effect is in, using eyeliner and then smudging it with a little shadow.\nFrosted sheen, gloss, or shimmer, stay popular for the lips. Lip liners match the lipstick -no obvious darker outline around lips, as in the past. In other words, the \"lip-lined\" look is out. Red and shades of red have made a comeback and will stay in vogue in lipsticks. Shades of red, like cherry, rose, plum and red itself are in fashion for the night. Lilac, mauve, soft pinks and rose find favour for the day. Orange is out. For the night, specially gala nights, bright metallic colours and glamorous lips are in. As for nails, pinks will be out and dark colours will be in, like burgundy and chocolate brown.\nMineral make-up has been in during recent times. It is based on loose powder, which does not contain perfume, alcohol, mineral oil, dyes, etc. The texture of mineral make-up is lighter, so it gives the skin a translucent quality, instead of a heavily made up look. The ingredients in mineral make-up are said to have sun-protective benefits too, apart from nourishing the skin. We have used 24 Carat pure gold in our Pot of Gold Foundation, which gives the skin a natural golden glow. Many of the minerals used in mineral make-up, like zinc oxide, are said to have healing benefits too. Gold, for instance, rejuvenates the skin and protects from oxidation damage.\nThe main trend that is influencing beauty is the view that looking beautiful is not just a matter of make-up, hairstyle or trendy clothes; fitness too plays an important role. Beauty care in coming years will strive for a radiance that comes from sheer good health, with energy, vitality, a slim and supple body and self-confidence. The key to beauty will be \"feeling good and looking great.\"\nNo flowery words, no jingles, jazzy introduction, impressive preface, catch lines, attention-grabbing gimmicks, nothing doing. When you write for causes, words fall short, inapt, perhaps this anecdote pulled out from the website of one of the NGOs itself might help.\nA man, once walking by the beach, sees starfish washed ashore. Fearing they'd die on being exposed to first rays of sunlight, he picks them all up and starts throwing them back into the sea. Another man passing by asks the logic behind his endeavour, 'What difference does it make? There are millions of starfish, how many would you save?' The previous man picks up yet another, takes two steps, flungs the star fish back into the sea and says, 'It makes a difference to this one'.\nIf you thought that was all we had, here's a dose on the other active social groups that are making a statement with their cause camaraderie. Mitra, a social group from UIET, actively came out to support the recent Earth Hour celebrations. It has been around for long and well, managed funds through a rather fun-way, like tambola games and organising cultural events.\nTheir name spells it! And puts their purpose and nature beyond obvious. Anyways, Youth United, a student NGO formed in 2006, already brags of 50 active members, 100 volunteers, two chapters; Chandigarh, Delhi with one in Patiala soon to be opened. They don't come without their share of problems, \"Frankly speaking, funds are a problem. We have a very hand to mouth existence, but for each event we somehow manage,\" says Saloni Bajaj, vice president Youth United. Their latest effort, Smiling Future, focuses on kids from underprivileged background.\n\"In one of the events, we had thousand forms filled from houses in Colony no. 5, talking of several problems. Drugs and education came out to be the biggest one.\" She adds, \"Right now we are focusing on the NGO part of the organisation.\" Focusing also includes picking up stumbling blocks spread in the way. \"Apart from the paucity of funds, there's not much support from the administration. But yes, Chandigarh Police has been very supportive.\" Why don't you go; add to their list of supporters?\nBIMAD- it isn't just some fancy nomenclature for a group of idealistic youngsters. Every alphabet counts; 'because I make a difference' came into being for exactly the same reasons and of course the madness to route out wrong. \"We were a group of vella college people, would discuss flaws in society. While everybody wants change, how many themselves be the change,\" questions Garima Bhayana of U.I.E.T. The student initiative of 8-10 founder members is the newest on the block; registered as late as May last. The non-profit, self funded registered as a Society organisation's not limited to a single cause. \"We work on diverse issues, it could be eve-teasing, environment, not wasting water…\" she clears the air.\nNo wonder, the projects take them to schools, colleges, wherever, but the 1800 strong volunteer team's not been a smooth sailing. \"Funds are a problem, at the end of the day you need fuel to run your car. We do not have dearth of ideas, but even after running there's been no sponsors,\" apprises Jaskaran Singh Arora, 3rd year U.I.E.T student, founder member, and the mind who came up with the name. He recalls, \"Once we had to put stickers, 'Please switch off the tap, it doesn't take long' above taps at public places, but we did not get permission from the MC on the grounds of defacement.\"\nIn the meantime, the guys have things in place to ensure continuity, \"When we got together, we made sure a lot of first year people joined us, so by the time we pass out and they get to take the reins.\" Live long!\nNot that there weren't tree plantations drive, 'don't waste water' kinda campaigns happening earlier, but the need to improve environment with a 360 degree approach catalyzed the dawn of Environment Saviors. \"We wanted to do something about the environment, same time not restrict our activities and take a holistic approach to problems,\" says Brhamesh Alipuria, from UIET. \"We took up Earth Hour project wherein we publicised on the net, spread awareness about the issue, involved media.\" The eight-member organisation though has not been formally launched but is open to volunteers. \"Our exams are on, so our next project's going to be on paper management,\" he adds.\nHere's a student initiative that started on the concept of think global, act local and giving a meaning to it. AIESEC, an entirely student managed organisation, has amalgamated corporate and social responsibility into one. \"We have diversified our work into three core areas- corporate development, public development and education,\" says Akkriti Bhatt, vice president, communications and information management. Their burning issues? \"We have undertaken various projects like Genesis and ASK in HIV AIDS programme, Footprints for child rights, Pragati in rural and community development, Project Conserve on environmental issues. Our corporate projects include Eureka and Pheonix,\" she adds. To fight global issues, they send volunteers to work with NGO's in various countries through our exchange programme. The age of the organisation almost similar to age of its current oldest member, say 23, it cashes on the most powerful resource ever- youth. Like most of them, money doesn't look like a problem. \"We partner over 3000 organisations globally that includes names like UNESCO, WHO, ABN AMRO. We send interns and volunteers through our exchange programme to work with corporates, NGO's and schools across 91 countries,\" says Akkriti. Joining them are the inspired young souls with a passion for serving from 850 universities around the globe. The local chapter has around 60 people in Chandigarh and 14 local committees across India. From street activities to organising auction dinners, these guys sure know how to brand their cause. And it's not all work and no play. The general body meetings over coffee or a cool resort in Shimla mean fun too. \"It's important to keep our youthful energies inspired,\" says our young comrade.\nStarted in 2007, this organisation is more or less one-man army. The goal was to associate young people with the idea of democracy, \"We want them to know that they have an option when it comes to running the country and that option is them,\" says Anurag Chauhan, professional advocate and the founder member of the organisation. The core work highlights the loopholes in the system, be it then Panjab University, remember last year's illegal felling of trees in PU, this man went to jail in protest, or the creating a political awareness. \"People should first know their rights and then demand their fulfillment,\" he says. He describes the Indian mindset through these words, \"We want a Bhagat Singh to be born again, but in our neighbour's house and not ours,\" he says. \"We have no right to criticize policies when we ourselves are not doing anything about them. \"It's not easy to wake people up, though,\" he adds. \"It needs a lot of inspiration, time and manpower and money too.\" so just like the inspiration and the spirit, money too is self generated, through events and campaigns. \"The day we stop escaping from issues, I would think we have broken the ice.\" His has a straight funda of believing in one's effort and not depending on others to change the world for you. \"People think you are mad, and one wants to get mad with you, so they don't want to be a part of the process. But the day we start escaping form issues, we will break the ice between us and the change,\" he says. His future plans include a 24/7 public helpline that will bail you out from the red tapist culture. Amen!\nWe know them as the determined bunch that changed the face of Student Center, the heart of all the campus activity. Their weapon, a broomstick, and their passion to 'clean up' things and the society, inspired many and made a breakthrough by changing mindsets. But just when things looked inspired enough, Sankalp suddenly made the disappearing act. Wonder why? \"Well, when we started three years back, we were a group of freshers, hoping to make a difference. But then for while now our studies have taken priority,\" says Nitin, founder member of Sankalp. But their hibernation doesn't mean that social service has taken a backseat. \" We are planning to get back together once our academic pressure gets over,\" he adds.\nHave a heart, got the will.\nThink and take your pick.\nSecurity and night food street (once again in news for all the wrong reasons) don't seem to gel very well. But this while, it was a parking clash amongst the gang of guys. We ask city youngsters, do they feel secure at the night food street? What can be done to prevent any untoward incident?\nI've been there only twice and it was a good experience. About this particular clash I'm not aware. But yes, the place does not come without its share of problems. It's very congested and they should make it more open. All the clashes and security problems mainly arise because there are a lot of drunkards loitering about the place. It should be banned for those sloshed out.\nI’ve been to food street, but never been there after seven or eight at night. When it comes to safety and security, nothing is safe, one needs to be careful themselves, moreover it all depends on the situation. The fact, that a lot of young college goers who are out merry making and at times, out of control is a major factor. Besides there should be cameras, PCR vans moving about to keep mischievous elements at bay.\nShagun Sharma, Political science student, Panjab University.\nIt's more of student crowd at the night food street, from the university and the nearby DAV College. Moreover, around night there are drunkards dotting the area. The nature and location of the place are such that one should expect troubles. We all know, it’s not the decent demure sorts who are likely to be found there, the straight simple crowd tucks up in the bed by nine. The reveller gang goes out of control, many a times. There ought to be more PCR vans or an active beat box nearby.",

            "text": "This veteran is waiting for the year in which the Veterans For Peace, in its Memorial Day Press Release, states that Veterans mourn first, the lives America took in poor countries, both the civilian men, women and children and the patriots that fought our illegal and criminal invasions since 1945. Only then should come bitterly mourning GIs who were duped by our elected officials and the CIA and Pentagon fed, corporate-controlled war-promoting media cartel fooling them with lies, misinformation, disinformation and psyop techniques that deceived them into proudly following homicidal criminal orders - which of course made them liable for prosecution. Orders given, as Martin Luther King Jr. cried out, \"for atrocity wars and covert homicide meant to maintain unjust predatory investments overseas.\"\nYour writer's four buddies from basic training, whose corpses are somewhere in North Korea, would have wanted this kind of a press release. They were normal guys, still kids really. We thought going into the army was just something everyone had to do. They would have been pissed off to see cruelly ignorant Americans praising them on Memorial Day for their sacrifice . Jesus knows they did not want to die for any reason, let alone while killing others for lies. They loved waking up in the morning, loved children, all children, cute Korean children, especially. They were asking themselves, why are we killing Koreans in their own country?\nIf these four young men knew what I know now, whew! If they could rise up, they would surely be going after those high ranking military with lots of colorful ribbons on their smart uniforms, surrounded by flags and glorifying the US war in Korea and in all the dozens of countries since.\nDamn! In 1945, the US Army landed in a Korea that America had recognized as Japanese territory since 1905 and during a forty year brutal occupation, in return for Japan's acceptance of the US claim to own the Philippines and other islands in Asian waters. [see Diplomacy That Will Live in Infamy, New York Times, James Bradley, 12/5/2009. See also the Taft-Katsura Agreement.] State Department officials quickly shut down the democratic all-Korea government the Japanese commanding general had allowed Koreans to form, once Japan was defeated. Knowing this Korean government would not be pro-US., they set up in its place, a US Army military government; cut the nation in two and installed a brutal Korean from Washington as President. His special services and secret police would account for massacres totaling up to nearly 200,000 men, women and their children, in the years before the army of North Korea invaded and united the peninsula in five short weeks as the army of the Southern dictator defected or went home. These massacres of communists, socialists, unionists and people that did not accept the US partition of their country kept secret by American media have now been fully document by a Truth and Reconciliation Commission set up by the South Korean Congress. [Korean Truth and Reconciliation Commission, Wikipedia] The US has recently officially apologized for its own massacres of civilians in the South.\nNorth Korea today is the most militarized nation on the planet because it was leveled twice by merciless bombing, threatened with atom bombs, and for sixty-three years has suffered US arranged international sanctions meant to cripple it, and a continual campaign of slanderous attack in US media and never ending threats from Washington, while twice a year, great war game exercises go on so near its coast that the booms of US naval ships' cannon and missiles are clearly heard in its capital city. Last month saw the largest naval live-fire exercise in history, reportedly with North Korean flags painted on targets. What else could be the explanation of its leader threatening to hit the US with the few nuclear weapons it has, knowing the America that menaces it has 20,000, and the most powerful armed force in the history of the world. But we have seen 'the crazy North Korean leader story' on prime time for a month. Last year right after US-South Korean war games, a South Korea warship was blown in two, probably by a US mine, but what is believed all over the Western media dominated world is that was an old North Korean torpedo. Who knows or cares that the Chinese, the Russian Navy and a Japanese investigation found the accusation not credible, that the US and its UN Secretary General stooge refused to consider a North Korea request for a UN investigation of what it was accused of. [see N. Korean Torpedo Accusation Fizzles: Strong Probability of US Mine Strike Investigated, Counter Currents 6/11/2010] No, the torpedo story was featured for weeks to justify tighter that ever sanctions and stronger threats than before, and Libya was a frightening example of what may be awaiting it.\nIf the media features for nine months, weaponized pick-up trucks run by tough looking hombres as peaceful demonstrators against the government of oil wealthy Libya, a nation with a living standard higher than nine European countries, it becomes 'truth,' and the liberator of what was the poorest country in Africa, and leader of African Unity against continuing European exploitation, winds up with a blade up his backside, after being cornered by British and French warplanes. No matter the president of Italy told media, \"Gadaffi is loved by his people.\"\nNote to US media personalities: Among the generals who were imprisoned or hung after trail at Nuremberg, were five media celebrities.\nThere are either similar absurd media concocted stories, or no story at all, that excuse US crimes against humanity in the dozens of nations US designated local bad guys have been mass murdered to help a little country out, and protect the American way of life in the US. America is so good to invade and bomb and overthrow violently governments all for the benefit of nearly a billion people.\nNote that remember, invading little countries was nothing new for the US before World War II - Mexico, Nicaragua, Haiti, Philippines, China, Puerto Rico, Cuba, and more.\nAgain, this veteran is hoping that the Veterans For Peace Memorial Day Statement Press Release will say that VFP, or at least many if not all VFP, mourn the patriots of US invaded countries that fell fighting against overwhelming odds, and their civilian countrymen and children who also fell in harms way of those US invading forces. To be polite, we mourn them first before mourning our own soldiers who were killed in the line of duty following our government's criminal orders. Otherwise how can anyone believe VFP condemns the taking of all these millions of lives of poor people overseas in illegal criminal military action; an illegal use of military that Representative from Texas, Congressman and Republican candidate for president, denounced (but did not call for prosecution).\nNothing less than this can possibly dent the usual Memorial Day adulation for dying for what Martin Luther King called \"atrocity wars for maintaining unjust predatory investments on three continents.\"\nHere is what this veteran would have Veterans For Peace to say to Americans on Memorial Day.\nNo Americans knows more about US Wars than your veterans, who fought alongside buddies who did not make it home alive and will be mourned throughout the nation this weekend.",

            "text": "Sports|FIFA’s Boss Wants to Remake the Game. Europe Wants No Part of It.\nFIFA’s Boss Wants to Remake the Game. Europe Wants No Part of It.\nFIFA President Gianni Infantino’s plans to reorder world soccer are being stymied by a familiar foe: Europe.\nSince proposing several major changes to the sport’s calendar last spring, Infantino has spent months traveling the world hosting minisummits with the leaders of FIFA’s 211 member federations. His goal is to win support for a proposal to introduce two new tournaments — an expanded World Cup for clubs and a new league for national teams — that would be underwritten by a $25 billion offer from a group led by the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank.\nThe listening exercise follows repeated failures by Infantino to force the proposals through FIFA’s governing council, but if they are approved they would represent the biggest changes to soccer in a generation, and their adoption — and the multibillion-dollar cash infusion to FIFA — would provide Infantino with a signature success ahead of his bid to secure a second term as FIFA president later this year.\nEach of the meetings on Infantino’s tour, including the most recent one held in Marrakesh, Morocco, has included about 50 federation leaders from across soccer’s six regional confederations. At the end of each session, the federation representatives are handed electronic tablets and asked to select their preferred options for the new tournaments.\nInfantino’s problem is that European officials attending the meetings have stubbornly refused to offer any opinions. Instead, they have told Infantino and his team that the feelings of Aleksander Ceferin, the president of the European governing body, UEFA, and his governing council represent their views.\nSome of the Europeans balked because the list of options for the Club World Cup did not include the option of not holding the tournament, which is often an annoyance for the European champion who attends, at all. On FIFA’s tablets, voters are asked to pick from only three choices: a tournament with 16, 24 or 32 teams.\nCeferin, under pressure from clubs and federations in Europe, has clashed repeatedly with Infantino over the proposed changes both to the Club World Cup and to the broader global soccer calendar, with Ceferin most frustrated by new initiatives that could challenge the hegemony of existing club tournaments like UEFA’s Champions League and add to the workload of players.\nInfantino first presented details of a plan for an expanded Club World Cup at a FIFA Council meeting in Bogotá, Colombia, last March. Citing a nondisclosure agreement, he refused to identify the financial backers of the proposal, which are believed to include not only SoftBank but also financing from the Middle East, which Infantino eventually denied were directly linked to sovereign wealth funds. (Saudi Arabia remains the biggest individual backer over Softbank’s Vision Fund, the biggest private-equity fund ever raised.) Instead, Infantino pressed the council to let him close the deal on his own.\nEuropean leaders at the meeting balked, and Ceferin and Infantino have not held a meeting since the Colombia summit. In October, European officials threatened to walk out of the last meeting when Infantino suggested he planned to call another vote.\nThe vote did not take place; instead, FIFA set up a task force involving representatives from the six confederations and asked it to produce an acceptable plan before a scheduled FIFA Council meeting in March in Miami.\nAt the last summit, in Morocco, Infantino expressed frustration to the officials who declined to take part in the vote for his plans, according to multiple people present at the meeting.\nFIFA’s task force for the two tournaments will hold its next meeting on Feb. 21 in Rio de Janeiro. As tensions grow, however, there is a chance that European executives will not attend, according to a person familiar with the continental leaders’ plans.\nUEFA declined to comment. The organization has been seeking the support of European clubs and leagues to oppose Infantino’s proposals. At the last two meetings, Ceferin has arrived armed with signed letters of opposition from The European Club Association, a union of the continent’s top clubs, and a separate group representing the continent’s domestic leagues.\nThe proposals to expand the Club World Cup and to create a new global Nations League similar to the recently created UEFA version largely have the backing of officials from South America, Africa and Asia — likely enough to win a vote should Infantino choose to take one at the Miami meeting. Any such move would exacerbate the growing rift with Europe, however, and potentially lead to a larger crisis if top clubs and leading nations from UEFA refuse to participate in the new FIFA-controlled tournaments.",
